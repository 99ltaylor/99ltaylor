|[Community Cadastre][7]| A 'Community Cadastre' is a way of making the UK's land ownership system more transparent. It uses open data and open-source software to create a database of land ownership records for a particular area. This database can then be used to predict missing data and to develop plans for improving the energy efficiency of local housing.|

### üé® &nbsp; Policy design, strategy & influence

| Title    | Description |
| -------- | --------|
|[Engaging Faith Communities][4]|I used a framework developed by Policy Lab to assess how the government currently interacts with faith communities. This helped me find areas where the government could be doing more and develop a plan to improve the relationship between the government and faith communities.|
|[Public Sector Equality Duty][5]|I worked with the senior leadership team to help the organisation follow its equality and diversity strategy, as required by the Equality Act 2010 and Public Sector Equality Duty. I did this by designing and running workshops for all staff, which challenged them to think about equality and diversity in new ways and showed them how to do it better.|
